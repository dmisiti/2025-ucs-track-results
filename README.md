# 2025 UCS Track Results - Performance Dashboard
Converting track/field results from all 1st-8th grade students into a dynamic visual dashboard on Tableau.

## About the Project

The goal of this dashboard is to display track athlete performances, allowing a user to interact with the dashboard so as to view their desired data.

Results data was stored in a spreadsheet containing athlete information and their individual results in each track and/or field event across each meet throughout the season.

The spreadsheet was saved as a CSV and connected to Tableau, in which the data was converted in to a dynamic visual dashboard.
